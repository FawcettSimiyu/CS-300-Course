**Working on the CS 300 Course Information Program?**  
This project involves reading a list of course offerings, parsing course data, storing it efficiently, and providing helpful output like a sorted course list or details on course prerequisites. I’ll guide you from pseudocode to implementation in C++.

---

### ✅ **What You’ll Get**

#### **1. Full Breakdown of the Course Data**
- 📄 **Understanding CSV Input Format**  
  I'll explain how to read and structure the input with fields like `courseNumber`, `name`, and variable-length `prerequisites`.

- 📚 **Course Prerequisite Mapping**  
  Get help constructing data structures that reflect prerequisite relationships—ideal for tree, graph, or hash map implementations.

#### **2. C++ Program Development Support**
- 🧠 **Pseudocode Planning**  
  I’ll help you draft clear, structured pseudocode before you write any real code.

- 📂 **Efficient Data Structures**  
  Get support implementing vectors, binary search trees (BST), or hash tables to store and retrieve course info efficiently.

- ⚙️ **Course Info Functions**  
  Build functions that:
  - Load data from a file
  - Display sorted course lists
  - Show a single course and its prerequisites

#### **3. Flowchart and Logic Design**
- 📊 **Visual Flowchart Creation**  
  I’ll create a simple visual flowchart showing how your program flows from loading data to user menu options.

- 🔄 **Menu-Driven Design**  
  Implement a looped menu system where users can:
  - Load data
  - Print course list
  - View details on a specific course
