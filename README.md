**Need assistance building the CS 300 advising assistant program?**  
I’m here to help you develop your C++ program that processes course data, handles prerequisites, and manages course advising effectively.

---

### ✅ **What You’ll Get**

#### **1. Understanding the Course Data**
The course data is structured as follows:
- **Course Number** (e.g., CSCI100)
- **Course Name** (e.g., Introduction to Computer Science)
- **Prerequisites** (e.g., CSCI101 depends on CSCI100)

This data will be processed in a program to display relevant course information and prerequisites.

---

#### **2. Designing the Program Flow with Pseudocode**
**Pseudocode Overview:**
- **Input:** The course data file will be parsed, and courses will be stored in appropriate data structures (e.g., vector, hash table, or binary search tree).
- **Processing:** The program will allow users to select a course and view its prerequisites.
- **Output:** The system will display the course list and prerequisites, ensuring accurate guidance for course advising.

---

#### **3. Code Implementation (C++)**
- **Reading Data:**  
  The program will read course data from a text file and store it in a suitable data structure.

- **Course Sorting and Display:**  
  Display courses sorted by course number and show the prerequisites for each course.

- **Menu System:**  
  A user-friendly menu allows the user to select a course and view its prerequisites.

---

#### **4. Flowchart for Program Design**
**Flowchart Steps:**
1. **Start** → Load Course Data → Display Main Menu
2. **Menu Option 1:** Display Courses → List Courses → Return to Main Menu
3. **Menu Option 2:** Show Prerequisites → Display Prerequisites for Selected Course → Return to Main Menu
4. **Exit** → End Program

### 📊 **Course Data Overview**
Here is an example of how the course data is structured in the program:

- **CSCI100** - Introduction to Computer Science  
- **CSCI101** - Introduction to Programming in C++  
  *Prerequisite: CSCI100*
- **CSCI200** - Data Structures  
  *Prerequisite: CSCI101*
- **MATH201** - Discrete Mathematics  
- **CSCI300** - Introduction to Algorithms  
  *Prerequisites: CSCI200, MATH201*
- **CSCI301** - Advanced Programming in C++  
  *Prerequisite: CSCI101*
- **CSCI350** - Operating Systems  
  *Prerequisite: CSCI300*
- **CSCI400** - Large Software Development  
  *Prerequisites: CSCI301, CSCI350*

This list is dynamically generated and displayed in your program based on user input.
